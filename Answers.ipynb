    "The initial focus is on position-level kinematics, specifically addressing both forward and inverse problems.  Coordinate frames are assigned using the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) convention and DH parameters are determined.  This setup allows for a straightforward computations of the foreward kinematics.  The inverse kinematics problem is approached using a closed-form geometric method, which is well-suited to this particular robot's DH parameter configuration.  The implementation of this geometric inverse function accounts for potential singularities and employs a computational strategy to handle multiple possible solutions.  The core challenge in inverse kinematics is to accurately determine the joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector pose, given the complexities introduced by numerous edge cases.\n",

    "The described geometric inverse kinematics method is implemented in the function `minibotinversekinematics.mini_bot_geometric_inverse`. This function takes the desired end-effector pose as input and uses the robot's kinematic parameters to return the sets of joint angles that achieve the desired pose. Below the provided transformation matrix is used with this function to find the corresponding joint angles. "
